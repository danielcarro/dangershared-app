# DangerShared App

## Project Description
**DangerShared App** is a mobile application developed in **React Native** that allows users to report small fire outbreaks in real time. Through the application, users can record a video of the fire location, send the video along with their GPS coordinates, and this information will be processed by an API that stores it in a database. The data is then forwarded to the appropriate authorities to take necessary action.

## Main Features
- **Video Capture**: Users can record up to 30 seconds of video showing the fire outbreak.
- **Location Sending**: The user’s location is automatically sent along with the video.
- **API Integration**: The video and location data are sent to an API that manages the data and notifies the relevant authorities.
- **Authority Notification**: Information about the incident is sent directly to the responsible firefighting or emergency services.

## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: Used for the development of the user interface and application functionalities.
- **Expo**: Used to facilitate development and manage dependencies in React Native.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling the interface.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing in the project, improving readability and maintainability of the code.
- **REST API**: The app communicates with an external API to send data.
- **Geolocation**: To automatically capture the user’s location.
